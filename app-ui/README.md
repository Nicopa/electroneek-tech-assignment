# User Chat Simulator UI App

## How to run
- Browser: Run `yarn start` to start the application and open `http://localhost:4200`;
- Electron: Run `yarn electron`;

## How to use
The first screen is the user list. On this screen, you can check every user you have created. In order to simulate the chat, you need to create at least one user. You can do it by clicking on "Create" on the left panel and filling up the form on the Canvas. You can submit the form using either asynchronous or synchronous request.

When you click on "Chat" button on the left panel, you will see two buttons: "Start Chat" and "Stop Chat". When you start the chat, you will see random sentences from random users **every three seconds**.

You can check the API requests and results in the console panel.
